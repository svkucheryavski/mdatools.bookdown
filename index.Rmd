# Introduction {-}

This is a user guide for _mdatools_ — R package for preprocessing, exploring and analysis of multivariate data. The package provides methods mostly common for [Chemometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics). The general idea of the package is to collect the popular chemometric methods and give a similar "user interface" for using them. So if a user knows how to make a model and visualize results for one method, he or she can easily do this for the other methods as well. Usually I update the tutorial when a new version of the package is released, you can track main changes [here][What is new].

All methods implemented in the package were tested using well-known datasets. However, there still could be some bugs, in this case please report to [svkucheryavski@gmail.com](mailto:svkucheryavski@gmail.com) or use [Issues tool](https://github.com/svkucheryavski/mdatools/issues) at GitHub. You are also very welcome to share your comments and suggestions about the package functionality.
