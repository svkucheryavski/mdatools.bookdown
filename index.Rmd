# Introduction {-}

This is a user guide for _mdatools_ — R package for preprocessing, exploring and analysis of multivariate data. 
The package provides methods mostly common for [Chemometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics). 
The general idea of the package is to collect the popular chemometric methods and give a similar "user interface" 
for using them. So if a user knows how to make a model and visualize results for one method, he or she can easily 
do this for the other methods as well.

I decided to rewrite this tutorial in order to add more details and examples for the implemented methods. 
This is a pre-release version and I am still working on it. So far it only presents how to work with datasets 
and plots as well as describes in details how to do PCA analysis and PLS regression. More chapters 
(classification, interval PLS, etc) will be available soon. You can track main changes 
in the text [here][What is new].

All methods implemented in the package were tested using well-known datasets. However, there still could be 
some bugs, in this case please report to [svkucheryavski@gmail.com](mailto:svkucheryavski@gmail.com) or 
use [Issues tool](https://github.com/svkucheryavski/mdatools/issues) at GitHub. You are also very welcome 
to share your comments and suggestions about the package functionality.
