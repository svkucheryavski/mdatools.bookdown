# What is new {-#news}

**31.03.2023**

* Added section about [normalization](#preprocessing--norm) to Preprocessing chapter.
* Added section about [missing values replacement](#preprocessing--mvreplace) to Preprocessing chapter.
* Improved description of validation procedure in PCA, PLS and other methods, including the use of Procrustes cross-validation.
* Small improvements in selected parts of text.

**09.11.2022**

Improved description of [iPLS](#ipls) section, including new features appeared in v. 0.13.1.

**03.03.2022**

* Added section explaining how to use `pcv.nareplace()` method

* Added separate section for Procrustes cross-validation.

**14.07.2022**

Added description of new features appeared in v. 0.13.0 of the package, including new plotting method `plotRMSERatio()` for PLS models and new cross-validation possibilities. Validation of PLS model text has been extended and made as separate section.


**12.09.2021**

Added description of new features appeared in v. 0.12.0 of the package, including:

* new preprocessing methods `prep.transform()`, `prep.varsel()`.
* improvements to `prep.savgol()` and `prep.norm()`.
* a possibility to combine several preprocessing method together and apply at once.

In addition to that, text for [Datasets](#datasets) chapter has been revised to provide more clear guides while the part about preprocessing was detached and now is available as [separate chapter](#preprocessing) where
you can find all details. Description of ALS baseline correction was moved to the section [Correction of baseline](#preprocessing--baseline).

**23.04.2021**

Added description of new features added in v. 0.11.4:

* using test set validation in [iPLS](#ipls).
* possibility to force selected contribution and spectral values in [MCR-ALS](#mcr--als).
* added information about how to provide user defined indices for pure variables in [Purity method](#mcr--purity)
* added link to relevant paper in the [PCA model complexity](#pca--model-complexity) section

**22.01.2021**

* added section about [Procrustes cross-validation](#pca--pcv) for PCA, which was recently added to the package (v. 0.11.3).

**23.07.2020**

* section about [MCR Purity method](#mcr--purity) has been re-written to correspond to the algorithm changes in v. 0.11.1.

**12.07.2020**

* added chapters about [MCR methods](#mcr) implemented in v. 0.11.0.
* added [description](#preprocessing--baseline) of new preprocessing methods `prep.alsbasecorr()`
* several small improvements in text
